<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>



<h2 class="faq-section">Practice</h2>

<h3 class="question">When and where is practice?</h3>
<p class="answer">Practice is at 5:00 p.m. at the entrance to Miller IM fields. See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/practice">practice page</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 class="question">What happens if I have a conflict with practice?</h3>
<p class="answer">If you have a conflict with practice, that's fine. To officially be considered a member of the club, you must attend practice at least two days per week.</p>

<h3 class="question">Do you have workouts and long runs?</h3>
<p class="answer">Yes. Workouts are usually twice a week on Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Thursday. Long runs are usually Saturday mornings at 9:00 a.m. and we go to Umstead or run from the normal practice location. Get on our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact-us">email list</a> and check our <a href="{{ site.facebook_page_url }}">Facebook page</a> for latest news on long runs.</p>

<h3 class="question">Do I have to do workouts?</h3>
<p class="answer">No. If you just want to do easy runs, feel free to do so. We have several people who only do easy runs. The same applies for races - you don't have to do them if you don't want to.</p>

<h3 class="question">How far do you run at practice?</h3>
<p class="answer">Most easy runs are between 4 and 9 miles. However, if you want to run more or less, you can turn around early.</p>

<h3 class="question">How fast are easy runs?</h3>
<p class="answer">The fastest group runs around 6:30 - 7:00 pace. We have groups that run 7:00 - 7:30, 7:30 - 8:00, and 8:00 and above. If you don't fit into any of these categories, we still encourage everyone to come out!</p>

<h3 class="question">Is practice held when it is raining?</h3>
<p class="answer">Yes, we run in the rain. We completely understand if you don't want to run in the rain, though.</p>

<h3 class="question">What should I expect at practice?</h3>
<p class="answer">A large group of people will be standing around before practice talking. When practice starts, a club officer will make announcements to the group about the day's run or workout, club dues, races, volunteering, social events, etc. Then the run or workout will begin. Afterwards, people will talk for a bit and go to eat at Clark or another dining hall.</p>

<h3 class="question">Where do you run?</h3>
<p class="answer">We have a list of routes we like to run. Stay tuned for a routes page or ask us at practice for more information.</p>
