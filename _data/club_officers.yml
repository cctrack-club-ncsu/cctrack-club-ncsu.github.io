  biography: "Hey fellow runners! I am a senior from Charlotte, NC majoring in Industrial Engineering and minoring in Statistics. When I'm not running I thoroughly enjoy leading with Cru, disc golfing, playing cards, and eating organic peanut butter. I was Wolfpack born and raised, and my favorite part about the Club team here is being able to remain competitive without the commitment of Varsity athletics. Other interests include biking, skiing, netflix-ing, and eating organic peanut butter. Did I mention I like peanut butter?"
