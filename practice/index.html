<h2>What to bring</h2>

<p>
    Come dressed in your running clothes and running shoes (or bring your running shoes to put on at practice). If you want, some people bring a water bottle, towel, and if it's a workout, spikes or flats.
</p>

<h2>What to expect</h2>

<p>At the start of practice, people will be standing around the entrance to the IM fields talking. A few minutes after, a club officer will make announcements - what the run/workout is, dues, upcoming runs and races, etc. - and everyone will go out running.</p>

<p class="center"><em>We hope to see you out there!</em></p>
